Ingredients:
500 grams boneless chicken, cut into small pieces

2 tbsp mustard seeds

1 tbsp fenugreek seeds

2 tbsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)

1 tsp turmeric powder

1 tbsp coriander powder

1 tbsp garam masala

4-5 garlic cloves, finely chopped or crushed

1-inch piece ginger, finely chopped or crushed

2 tbsp lemon juice or tamarind paste (for tanginess)

Salt to taste

1/2 cup mustard oil (or any cooking oil)

1 tbsp jaggery or sugar (optional, to balance flavors)

Fresh coriander leaves for garnish (optional)

Instructions:
Cook the chicken:
Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan, add chicken pieces and cook until they turn white (not fully cooked). Remove and set aside.

Prepare spice mix:
Dry roast mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds until fragrant. Let cool, then coarsely grind them.

Cook the pickle base:
In the same pan, heat mustard oil until smoking, then lower heat.
Add garlic and ginger, saut√© until golden.
Add turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, garam masala, salt, and the ground mustard-fenugreek powder. Stir well.

Add chicken:
Add the partially cooked chicken pieces to the spice mix. Mix thoroughly so chicken is coated well.

Simmer:
Add lemon juice or tamarind paste and jaggery/sugar (if using).
Cook on low heat until the chicken is fully cooked and the oil starts separating from the mixture (around 15-20 minutes). Stir occasionally to avoid sticking.

Cool and store:
Let the pickle cool completely.
Transfer to a clean airtight jar and refrigerate.

Serving:
Enjoy chicken pickle as a spicy side with rice, parathas, or bread!
