Ingredients:
4 cups milk (full-fat works best)

4 tbsp custard powder (vanilla flavor)

1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)

2 cups mixed fruits (chopped) â€” apple, banana, grapes, mango, pineapple, pomegranate, berries, etc.

1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)

Instructions:
Prepare custard:
Take custard powder in a small bowl. Add about 1/2 cup cold milk and mix well to form a smooth paste without lumps.

Heat milk:
In a saucepan, bring the remaining milk to a boil.

Cook custard:
Reduce heat to low. Slowly add the custard paste to the boiling milk while stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
Add sugar and keep stirring until the mixture thickens to a creamy consistency (about 5-7 minutes).

Cool custard:
Remove from heat and add vanilla extract if using. Let it cool to room temperature, then refrigerate to chill.

Add fruits and serve:
Once custard is chilled, add chopped mixed fruits and mix gently.
Serve immediately or keep chilled until serving.
