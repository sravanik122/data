Ingredients:
For the Meat:
1 kg chicken or mutton pieces (bone-in preferred)

2 large onions, thinly sliced

2 tomatoes, chopped

3-4 green chilies, slit

2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste

1/2 cup yogurt (curd)

1/4 cup fresh coriander leaves, chopped

1/4 cup mint leaves, chopped

2 tsp red chili powder

1 tsp turmeric powder

2 tsp garam masala powder

1 tbsp coriander powder

1 tbsp Mandi spice mix (optional â€” see below)

Salt to taste

1/4 cup cooking oil or ghee

For the Rice:
3 cups basmati rice

6 cups water or stock

1 large onion, sliced

4-5 whole spices (2 bay leaves, 4 cardamoms, 4 cloves, 1 cinnamon stick)

Salt to taste

Mandi Spice Mix (optional):
1 tsp cumin powder

1 tsp coriander powder

1/2 tsp black pepper powder

1/2 tsp cardamom powder

1/2 tsp cinnamon powder

1/4 tsp cloves powder

Instructions:
Marinate the meat:
In a large bowl, combine chicken/mutton with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, coriander powder, garam masala, salt, and half of the sliced onions.
Add chopped coriander and mint leaves. Mix well and marinate for at least 2 hours (preferably overnight).

Prepare the rice:
Rinse and soak basmati rice for 30 minutes.
Boil water with whole spices, salt, and sliced onion.
Add soaked rice and cook until about 70% done. Drain and keep aside.

Cook the meat:
Heat oil or ghee in a heavy-bottomed pot.
Fry the remaining sliced onions until golden brown.
Add marinated meat and tomatoes. Cook on medium heat until meat is tender and oil separates from the gravy.

Layer the Mandi:
In a large heavy pot, spread the cooked meat with its gravy at the bottom.
Layer the partially cooked rice on top of the meat evenly.

Dum cooking:
Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal with aluminum foil and then the lid.
Cook on very low heat for 25-30 minutes to let the flavors meld and rice finish cooking (dum style).

Serve:
Gently mix the rice and meat before serving. Garnish with fried onions and fresh coriander if desired.
Serve hot with raita or salad.
