Ingredients:
4 raw green mangoes (firm, sour)

4 tbsp mustard seeds (rai)

2 tbsp fenugreek seeds (methi)

1 tbsp fennel seeds (saunf)

2 tbsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)

1 tsp turmeric powder

3 tbsp salt (adjust to taste)

1 cup mustard oil (or any preferred oil)

1 tbsp asafoetida (hing)

Instructions:
Prepare mangoes:
Wash and dry mangoes thoroughly (any moisture can spoil the pickle).
Cut into small bite-sized pieces, removing the seed.

Dry roast and grind spices:
Dry roast mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, and fennel seeds separately on low heat until fragrant.
Let cool and coarsely grind mustard and fenugreek seeds together. Keep fennel seeds whole or lightly crushed.

Mix spices with mangoes:
In a large bowl, add mango pieces, salt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, asafoetida, ground mustard-fenugreek powder, and fennel seeds. Mix well.

Heat oil:
Heat mustard oil until it starts smoking, then let it cool a bit.
Pour the warm oil over the mango-spice mixture. Mix everything thoroughly.

Pack and rest:
Transfer the pickle to a clean, dry airtight jar.
Keep the jar in sunlight or a warm place for 7-10 days, shaking the jar daily to mix the pickle.

Storage:
After the resting period, the pickle is ready to eat.
Store in a cool dry place or refrigerator for longer shelf life.
