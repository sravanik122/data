Ingredients:
500 grams fish fillets or steaks (pomfret, kingfish, tilapia, or your choice)

2 tbsp lemon juice

1 tsp turmeric powder

2 tsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)

1 tsp black pepper powder

1 tbsp ginger-garlic paste

1 tsp garam masala powder (optional)

Salt to taste

3 tbsp rice flour or cornflour (for crispiness)

Oil for shallow frying

Fresh coriander or lemon wedges (for garnish)

Instructions:
Prepare fish:
Clean and pat dry the fish pieces.
Make 2-3 shallow slashes on each piece for better marination.

Marinate:
In a bowl, mix lemon juice, turmeric, red chili powder, black pepper, ginger-garlic paste, garam masala (if using), and salt.
Rub this mixture all over the fish, including the slits.
Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes (longer for more flavor).

Coat fish:
Sprinkle rice flour or cornflour evenly on the marinated fish pieces. This helps create a crispy crust.

Fry fish:
Heat oil in a frying pan on medium heat.
Carefully place fish pieces in the hot oil.
Fry until golden brown and cooked through, about 4-5 minutes per side depending on thickness.

Drain:
Remove fish and drain excess oil on paper towels.

Serve:
Garnish with fresh coriander or lemon wedges.
Serve hot with rice, salad, or chutney.
