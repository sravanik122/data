Ingredients:
500 grams tomatoes (firm and ripe)

3 tbsp mustard seeds

2 tbsp fenugreek seeds (methi seeds)

1 tbsp cumin seeds

2 tbsp red chili powder (adjust to taste)

1 tsp turmeric powder

1 tbsp salt (adjust to taste)

1/4 cup mustard oil (or any oil you prefer)

1 tbsp asafoetida (hing)

2 tbsp jaggery or sugar (optional, balances taste)

1 tbsp lemon juice (optional)

Instructions:
Prepare the tomatoes:
Wash and dry the tomatoes. Cut them into small pieces or cubes.

Roast the spices:
Dry roast mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, and cumin seeds on medium heat until fragrant (about 1-2 minutes).
Let them cool, then grind them coarsely using a mortar-pestle or spice grinder.

Cook the tomatoes:
Heat mustard oil in a pan till it starts to smoke lightly, then reduce the heat.
Add asafoetida and stir quickly.
Add chopped tomatoes and cook on medium heat until they become soft and mushy (about 10-15 minutes).

Add spices:
Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, salt, and the ground roasted spice mix to the tomatoes. Mix well.

Simmer:
Cook the mixture on low heat, stirring occasionally, until it thickens and oil starts to separate on the edges.

Add sweetener and lemon juice:
Add jaggery or sugar and mix well (optional but gives a nice balance).
Remove from heat and add lemon juice for a tangy twist (optional).

Cool and store:
Let the pickle cool completely before transferring it to a clean, dry airtight jar.
