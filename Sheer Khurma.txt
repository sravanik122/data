Ingredients:
1 liter full-fat milk

100 grams vermicelli (thin, roasted if possible)

10-12 dates, chopped

1/4 cup sugar (adjust to taste)

10-12 almonds, chopped

10-12 pistachios, chopped

1 tsp cardamom powder

2 tbsp ghee (clarified butter)

2 tbsp raisins

1 tbsp chopped cashews (optional)

A pinch of saffron strands (optional, soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk)

Instructions:
Roast vermicelli:
Heat ghee in a heavy pan. Add vermicelli and roast on medium flame until golden brown, stirring constantly to avoid burning.

Boil milk:
In another heavy-bottomed pot, bring milk to a boil.

Cook vermicelli in milk:
Add the roasted vermicelli to the boiling milk. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until vermicelli softens (about 8-10 minutes).

Add dates and sugar:
Add chopped dates and sugar to the milk-vermicelli mixture. Stir well until sugar dissolves.

Add nuts, raisins, and flavor:
Add almonds, pistachios, raisins, cardamom powder, and saffron milk (if using). Mix well.

Simmer:
Let it cook on low heat for another 5-7 minutes to thicken slightly.

Serve:
Sheer Khurma can be served warm or chilled, as per your preference.
