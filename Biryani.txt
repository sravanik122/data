For Rice:

1-inch cinnamon stick

2 bay leaves

For Biryani:

3 tbsp ghee or oil

A pinch of saffron soaked in ¼ cup warm milk

Fresh coriander and mint leaves for garnishing

Instructions:
Marinate the chicken:
In a large bowl, mix chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, coriander powder, garam masala, cumin powder, salt, lemon juice, chopped mint, coriander, and green chilies.
Cover and marinate for at least 2 hours (preferably overnight in the fridge).

Prepare the rice:
Rinse basmati rice 2-3 times and soak it for 30 minutes.
Boil water with cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, bay leaves, and salt.
Add the soaked rice and cook until it’s 70% cooked (rice grains should still be firm). Drain and set aside.

Fry onions:
Fry thinly sliced onions in oil or ghee until golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels and keep aside.

Layer the biryani:
In a heavy-bottomed pot, spread half of the marinated chicken.
Add half of the fried onions on top.
Layer half of the cooked rice over the chicken and onions.
Sprinkle some saffron milk, mint, and coriander leaves.
Repeat the layers with remaining chicken, onions, and rice.
Top with remaining saffron milk and a dollop of ghee.

Cook on dum:
Seal the pot with a tight-fitting lid or cover with aluminum foil and then the lid.
Cook on very low heat for about 40-45 minutes. You can place a tawa (griddle) below the pot to avoid direct heat.

Serve:
Gently fluff the biryani before serving.
Serve hot with raita or salan (spicy curry) and salad.
