Ingredients:
250 grams dried apricots (khubani)

1 cup sugar (adjust to taste)

4 cups water

1/2 cup milk (optional, for creaminess)

2 tbsp ghee (clarified butter)

10-12 almonds, blanched and sliced

10-12 pistachios, sliced

1 tsp cardamom powder

1 tbsp rose water or kewra water (optional)

Instructions:
Soak apricots:
Wash dried apricots and soak them in warm water for 1-2 hours until they soften.

Cook apricots:
In a heavy-bottomed pan, add soaked apricots along with the soaking water.
Cook on medium heat until apricots are very soft and the water reduces to a thick syrup.

Add sugar and milk:
Add sugar and stir well until dissolved.
Add milk if using, and cook for another 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and becomes creamy.

Add flavor:
Stir in cardamom powder and rose or kewra water.

Garnish:
Heat ghee in a small pan and lightly fry the sliced almonds and pistachios until golden.
Pour the ghee and nuts over the apricot mixture.

Serve:
Serve warm or chilled in bowls, garnished with extra nuts if desired.
